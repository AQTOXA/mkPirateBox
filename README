FEATURES:
 - Execute this script to your fresh OpenWRT Backfire installation
   and out comes (hopefully) a ready-to-use PirateBox.

TODO:
 - Test other Platforms than Asus WL-500gP
 - Error checking
 - Move stage two completely into the init script
 - Wrap it up in an opk package

REQUIREMENTS:
 - Decently powerful router with USB2.0 port which is supported by OpenWRT.
   It should have 32 MByte RAM and 4 MByte flash. If you want a
   recommendation: get a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH or an Asus WL-500gP.
 - An external USB hard drive (UMS compatible) formattet with FAT32.
 - Two ethernat cables

INSTALL:
  - Install a fresh OpenWRT "Backfire" 10.03.1 onto your router.
    I mean really fresh. Do not touch it after you flashed it!
  - Connect the WAN port to your gateway and a LAN port to your
    computer. This ensures the router can download packages.
  - Connect your USB drive. The script assumes a single partition
    with a FAT32 file system.
  - telnet into the router on 192.168.1.1.
  - cd /tmp
  - opkg update && opkg install wget
  - wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/cr/mkPirateBox/raw/master/mkPirateBox.sh
  - chmod +x mkPirateBox.sh
  - ./mkPirateBox.sh
  - Follow the instructions until the first reset.
  - Wait for the open wireless network "PirateBox" to appear.
  - Connect and open any web page.
  - If you see the PirateBox menu, you're done.
  - See /root/mkPirateBox.log in case anything went wrong during
    the invisible setup phase 2.
  - To start over, rm -rf /overlay/* or reflash OpenWRT.
