# mkPirateBox v0.2-1
# IPKG that installs PirateBox to your fresh OpenWRT router
# (C) 2011, Christiane Ruetten, cr@23bit.net

FEATURES:
 - Install this IPKG on your fresh OpenWRT "Backfire", and out comes
   (hopefully) a ready-to-use PirateBox.
 - Now supports devices with 4 MByte flash
 - Tested on Asus WL-500gP, Asus WL-500g and Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH

TODO:
 - Test other platforms
 - Does not uninstall cleanly
 - Better error checking

REQUIREMENTS:
 - Decently powerful router with USB2.0 port which is supported by OpenWRT.
   It should have 200MHz, 32 MByte RAM and 4 MByte flash. If you want a
   recommendation: get a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH or an Asus WL-500gP.
 - A 125 MHz system works, but HTTP uploads may drop dramatically to
   about 100 KByte/s.
 - An external USB hard drive (UMS compatible) formattet with FAT32.
 - Two ethernet cables

INSTALL:
  - Install a fresh OpenWRT "Backfire" 10.03.1 onto your router.
    I mean really fresh. Do not touch it after you flashed it!
    If you already have an unclean install, do rm -rf /overlay/*
    and reboot the router.
  - Connect the WAN port to your gateway and a LAN port to your
    computer. This ensures the router can download packages.
  - Connect your USB drive. The script assumes a single partition
    with a FAT32 file system.
  - telnet into the router on 192.168.1.1.
  - cd /tmp
  - wget http://cr.23bit.net/piratebox/piratebox_0.2-1_all.ipk
    (Sorry, github only supports https downloads.)
  - opkg update && opkg install piratebox*
  - When prompted, set a root password.
  - Wait for the setup to finish which is when the open wireless
    network "PirateBox" appears.
  - Connect wirelessly and open any web page.
  - If you see the PirateBox menu, you're done.
  - You can disconnect the WAN connection now.
  - To start over or completely uninstall, rm -rf /overlay/* and
    reboot or reflash OpenWRT.
